# Parse

The `parse()` core function is used to parse your schema and input data, and then run all the validations on your fields.

It's exported as a separate function which you can use, but it's also important to know that each **schema** provides a `parse()` function.

## Example

```ts
const mySchema = object({ ... });

parse(mySchema, { ... });
// Or you can do
mySchema.parse({ ... });
```
